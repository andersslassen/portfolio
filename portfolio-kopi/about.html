About.

<div class="p2">
<p>I am an innovative 20 year old independent multimedia designer working with everything <br>ranging from graphic design, photography, video editing, webdesign, print design and <br>communication. I have a strong work ethic and because of that I am always 100% <br>dedicated to the project I am working with. I strive to evolve on a personal level and attempt<br> to expand my skillset as every day passes. I love the diversity when working with design <br>projects in teams, just as much as I like the freedom when working on a project on my own.

Personal life.

<div class="p2">
<p>Currently I am living in a city called Odense which is Denmarks third largest city. It is <br>located on a small island called Fyn, situated between Jylland and Sjælland. I recently<br> moved from Sjælland to Fyn because I wanted to study multimedia design, which is a<br> big passion of mine. When I am not busy studying, I am probably at work at IKEA, where <br> I work with customer service. <br><br>In my freetime I love to listen to hiphop which I have had a big interest in since I was <br>a little kid. Besides that I like playing or watching football in the television or even playing<br> some FIFA on my Playstation. At the weekends (if I'm not working or have to study the<br>next day) you can always find me at one of Odenses bars or nightclubs having a good <br>time with my friends.</p>
